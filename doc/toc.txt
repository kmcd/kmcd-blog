   Lean (John Seddon, Lean UK 2009)
      1. Do not apply same principles from manufacturing to services
      2. Study your process and follow a piece of work from entrance to exit (value work and wasted work)
      3. Study demand and see which is predictable and address it using another system
      4. Identify system's conditions for creating waste, not activities performed by people
      5. Change is emerging, something you never plan for
      6. Putting control in the hand of the workers give you more control than you ever had
      7. Never manage with targets, never manage with other arbitrary measures unless you're going over a clif
      8. Use measures that derive from purpose and put them in the hand of the workers
