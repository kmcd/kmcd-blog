I use the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition for my own learning and on the job teaching and mentoring software developers (mainly Ruby/Rails).

The theory is that people progress through five stages of competence as they learn. The five stages are Novice, Advanced beginner, Competent, Proficient and Expert.

h2. Novices

* donâ€™t want to learn - just want to see something working
* need clear rules / steps to follow / recipies
* can't troubleshoot and can get horribly stuck

h2. Advanced beginners

* can complete basic tasks unaided
* need information fast
* dont want the big picture
* will still have difficulty troubleshooting


h2. Competent people

* work from conscious, deliberate planning
* can solve problems on their own
* seek and use advice from experts
* can still get stuck on a tricky problem

h2. Proficient practicioners

* need to see the big picture, ie to put their actions into context
* can reflect on & self-correct their work
* can learn from the experience of others

h2. Experts

* work from from intuition
* may have difficulty describing their thought processess
* know which details to focus on and which to ignore
* are constantly looking for ways to improve

h2. How to use the Dreyfus model to your advantage

Your level of competence varies per skill. You may be an expert in, say, Ruby but a complete novice in graphic design.

Merely knowing what level you are at each skill helps me immensely. For example, if I'm a novice, I'll seek out and write down the rules I need to follow.

Having an appreciation of what people need at different levels of competence helps me be more patient when teaching & mentoring. Also, it provides a roadmap for learing.
