My take on TDD
   - not just unit testing: biz, usability, cash flow, performance, cust dev
   - context is key
   - only test what is likely to break
   - dont test everything
   - make sure you test whats important (in context of current project)
   - examples ( trading script, payroll, consumer app, startup, ... )
